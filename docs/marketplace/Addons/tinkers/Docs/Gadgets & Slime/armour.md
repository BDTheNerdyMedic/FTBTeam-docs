### Travelers Armour

![Travelers Armour](../../_assets/images/tinkers-travelers_armour.png)

Travelers Armour can be crafted using Copper Ingots and Leather in a Crafting Table.

Think of this as an upgraded regular Leather set, which has slightly better defence.

The Traveler's Set can also be combined with Gold Ingots in a Tinker's Anvil to create the Traveler's Gold Armor. 

However, this is purely cosmetic and won't provide any other benefits.

### Plate Armour

Plate Armour is crafted using Cobalt Ingots and Chains.

It has fairly high durability and protection stats which are slightly higher than a regular Iron set.

Plate Armor is also highly customizable. By combining a piece with any of the three types of ingots in a Tinker's Anvil, you can change its appearance to match the ingot's material. 

However, this is purely cosmetic and won't grant any additional benefits.

### Slime Armour

Slime Armour can be created by pouring Liquid Ender Slime onto either a Rabbit Foot, Shulker Shell, Plate Chestplate or Travelers Googles.
