### What is Tinkers' Construct?

Originally a beloved Java mod by *mDiyo*, Tinkers' Construct lets you craft seriously awesome weapons and tools that pack a punch.

But it's not just about bashing things. Tinkers' Construct throws in a whole new system, the Smeltery, for processing your ores like a pro. Plus, there's a treasure trove of gadgets, items, blocks, and even some new mobs to keep things interesting.

*FTB* brought all this goodness to the **Bedrock Edition** of Minecraft, so console and mobile players can join the fun.  

While it's not a perfect copy of the original Java mod, it keeps the core ideas that make Tinkers' Construct awesome.  Get ready to craft, fight, and explore in a whole new way!
