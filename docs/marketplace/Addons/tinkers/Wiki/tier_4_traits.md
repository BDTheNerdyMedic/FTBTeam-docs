## Tier 4 Traits

Materials have special abilities called traits.

Here are the Tier 4 Traits: 

**Bounce**
- Soar to new heights! Wielding this tool grants a powerful jump boost and a soft landing in most cases.

**Plunder**
- Slain foes shower you with riches, with a chance for their loot to become more plentiful.

**Floaty**
- Your attacks pack such a punch, they send foes on a one-way trip to the stratosphere.

**Guarding**
- Stand your ground! This trait absorbs the force of blows, keeping you steady in combat.
