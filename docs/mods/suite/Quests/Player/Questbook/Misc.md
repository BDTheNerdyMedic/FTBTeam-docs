## Auto-pinning quests

You can tell FTB Quests to automatically pin quests, so they are always visible. To do this, open the questbook and click the pin icon in the top right of the screen.
This will pin all of the quests in the questbook, in large modpacks this may cause the list of quests to go off the screen.
