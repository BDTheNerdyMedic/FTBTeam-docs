The questbook is a simple and easy-to-use way to track your progress in the game. It is divided into chapters, each of which contains a number of quests. Each quest has a title, a description, and a set of objectives that you need to complete in order to finish it. When you complete a quest, you will be rewarded with items, experience, or other rewards.

## How to open the Questbook

You can open the questbook by opening your inventory and clicking on the book icon in the top left of the screen. This will open the questbook interface, where you can see all of the quests and chapters that are available.

There is also a questbook item that you can craft and use to open the questbook interface.

If you are playing a modpack that does not have any quests added to it the questbook will be empty.

On modpacks that have quests such as FTB University, you will see a list of chapters on the left side of the screen. Clicking on a chapter will show you the quests that are available in that chapter.
Some quests and chapters may be hidden until you complete other quests or chapters first.
