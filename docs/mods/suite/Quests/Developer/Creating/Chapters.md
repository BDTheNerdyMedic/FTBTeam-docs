## Creating Chapters

At least 1 chapter is required for a quest to be created.

To create a chapter, expand the sidebar on the left and click on the green `+` button, this will open a menu where you can either create a new chapter or chapter group.

A chapter group is a way to organize your chapters into categories, for example, you could have a chapter group called "Introduction" and then have all of your introductory chapters inside that group.
