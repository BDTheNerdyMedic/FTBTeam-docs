title: Disable (Neo)Forge Processor Hashes Check)
---

This workaround will ignore the processor hashes checks for Forge and NeoForge. This is currently only a known issue with Fedora Linux using a specific fork of zlib (zlib-ng).

# Disabling the processor hashes check


## Disabling FTB Hide/FTB Progress

1. Open the FTB App
2. Go to the Instance you want to disable FTB Hide/FTB Progress on
3. Click on the Setting button on the right of the screen
4. Scroll down to the `Advanced` section and then the enable `Disable helper mod injection` option

   ![Advanced Instance Settings](./../../_assets/images/ftb-app-disable-hide-progress.png)

When you start the modpack up now, you should notice that the Minecraft loading screen is no longer hidden.
