## Screenshots

### Windows

You can take screenshots on Windows using the snipping tool. 

To open the snipping tool, press <kbd>Windows</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>.
You can now select the area you want to capture, after it takes the screenshot it will copy it to your clipboard and also save it to your `Pictures` > `Screenshots` folder.

As Windows copies the screenshot to your clipboard, you can paste it directly into Discord or the screenshot textbox while creating an issue on our GitHub.

### MacOS
On MacOS, you can take screenshots using the following shortcuts:
- Full screen: <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>3</kbd>
- Partial screen: <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> + <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> + <kbd>4</kbd>

This screenshot will be saved to your desktop with the name `Screenshot [date] at [time].png`
You can then upload this screenshot to Discord or GitHub by dragging and dropping it into the chat or issue textbox.
