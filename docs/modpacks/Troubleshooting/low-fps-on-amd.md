title: Low FPS on AMD
description: Noticing performance issues with Minecraft whilst using an AMD GPU? Try turning Mipmapping off.
---

Due to the way that AMD graphics cards handle OpenGL's Mip Mapping system it can sometimes lead to frame stuttering and low FPS.

Luckily, the solution for this is nice and simple!

## Turn of Mipmaps

- Start the game
- Go to `options`
- Then `Video Settings`
- Finally find the slider called `Mipmap Levels` and drag this slider to the left until the text shows `OFF`. Typically you will need to scroll down to find the `Mipmap Levels` option.

After doing this you should be able to see much better FPS performance and less frame stuttering whilst you're enjoying our Modpacks!
